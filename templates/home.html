Images can be powerful teaching tools, as illustrations to in-class lectures for studying concepts outside of the classroom. Sharing images online with other students, whether embedded in a presentation file or as stand-alone images in a particular course is usually a process of making a concept more clear to understand. Whereas videos increase student engagement, which in turn helps to boost up achievement. If students are interested in the material, they will better process and remember it. The use of videos in teaching and learning serves to not only benefit students, but also teachers and their affiliated institutions.

    <p id="para4" class="mt-1  mb-4 text-justify">Evaluators should never skip the fact that students taking exams from home can resort to unfair means, given that there is no one to check up on them. Evaluators must take the outmost precision while designing a test for each candidate. Asking these questions that are not readily available in text books and the internet but related to the particular subject of which the exam is being conducted, this will ensure the uniqueness and security of the test. Adding a timer to each question will place the condition upon participants to complete all questions in time, this helps in preventing cheating.
Now you know the merits and demerits of using the technology. We can offset the benefits with the drawbacks to obtain a better understanding of the product. Further, your suggestions are welcomed.
